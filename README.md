🩴 How to Wear Sandals

1. Identify your sandals

Make sure they are actual sandals, not a mouse pad or a drink coaster.



2. Check your feet

Optional, but clean feet make your sandals last longer (and smell nicer).



3. Find left and right sandals

They’re usually shaped differently. If you swap them, your feet might file a complaint.



4. Slide your feet in

Right foot in the right sandal, left foot in the left sandal (this is advanced science 🧠).



5. Test walk

Take 2–3 steps. If you hear “flip-flop” sounds, congratulations — you’re wearing them correctly.
