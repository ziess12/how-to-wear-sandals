Hi, you know?
Of course you don’t, right?
So why am I writing this text? Why? How?

If you’re reading this, it means you’ve entered my game.
“What game?” you might ask.
Yes, of course — the game here is just an idea.
By coming this far, you’re already participating.

Rules? You probably want to know the rules, don’t you?
Have we ever met before? Never, right?

The point is simple: this is just a philosophical line about life.
When you’re down, when you rise,
nothing is instant. You know that.
